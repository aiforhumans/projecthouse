# AI Housing Search Assistant

## Overview

The **AI Housing Search Assistant** is an intelligent system designed to help users find housing based on their preferences. It automates the search process, monitors listings in real time, and notifies users as soon as a suitable house becomes available. The AI also assists users in responding promptly to listings, increasing their chances of securing a home before others.

## Features

- **Automated Housing Search**: AI scans multiple housing websites and databases for available properties.
- **Personalized Preferences**: Users can input specific criteria such as location, budget, size, amenities, and preferred real estate platforms.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Alerts users via email, SMS, or push notifications as soon as a matching house is found.
- **Automated Inquiry Assistance**: Generates personalized responses and inquiry messages for landlords or agents to improve response time.
- **AI-Driven Price and Trend Analysis**: Provides insights on rental/buying trends and pricing fluctuations.
- **Interactive Chatbot**: Helps users refine searches, ask questions about listings, and provide recommendations.

## Proof of Concept

### **1. Data Collection**

- The system scrapes housing data from multiple sources such as Zillow, Craigslist, and local real estate websites.
- APIs from housing platforms and government databases provide structured property data.
- AI parses unstructured listings using NLP to extract useful details like price, square footage, and amenities.

### **2. AI-Powered Search and Matching**

- Machine learning models filter listings based on user preferences.
- An intelligent ranking system prioritizes listings based on availability, affordability, and user feedback.
- The AI can suggest nearby alternatives if the preferred location has limited options.

### **3. Notification System**

- When a match is found, the system sends instant notifications through:
  - **Email Alerts**
  - **SMS Notifications**
  - **Push Notifications (Mobile/Web App)**
- Users receive essential details such as price, location, photos, and contact information of the landlord/agent.

### **4. Automated Inquiry Assistance**

- AI generates a pre-filled message for users to contact the landlord.
- Users can customize the message or let AI optimize it for better response rates.
- AI tracks responses and provides follow-up suggestions.

### **5. AI Response and Feedback Learning**

- AI refines recommendations based on user interactions and feedback.
- It learns user preferences over time to improve future searches.
- Predictive analytics estimate the likelihood of a listing remaining available based on past data.

## Development Plan

### **Phase 1: Research & Planning (1-2 months)**

- Define project scope and key features.
- Conduct market research on existing housing search platforms.
- Identify the best data sources (APIs, web scraping targets, etc.).
- Outline technical requirements and infrastructure.
- Design system architecture and choose technology stack.

### **Phase 2: Data Collection & Processing (2-3 months)**

- Implement web scraping using Scrapy and BeautifulSoup.
- Develop API integrations for structured housing data.
- Create a pipeline for cleaning and structuring data.
- Store property data in a database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB).

### **Phase 3: AI & Machine Learning Development (3-4 months)**

- Train NLP models for extracting key housing details.
- Build a recommendation engine using machine learning algorithms.
- Implement predictive analysis for price trends and availability.
- Optimize search algorithms based on user feedback.

### **Phase 4: UI & Notification System (2-3 months)**

- Develop a web interface with user dashboards and search filters.
- Implement real-time push notifications, SMS, and email alerts.
- Design an interactive chatbot for refining search queries.

### **Phase 5: Automated Response System (2 months)**

- Create AI-powered message templates for contacting landlords.
- Implement natural language generation (NLG) for personalized responses.
- Develop an automated follow-up system for tracking responses.

### **Phase 6: Testing & Optimization (2-3 months)**

- Conduct usability testing with real users.
- Optimize performance and fix bugs based on feedback.
- Implement security measures for user data protection.
- Finalize AI model tuning and deploy the system.

### **Phase 7: Deployment & Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)**

- Launch the AI Housing Search Assistant.
- Monitor user engagement and improve based on analytics.
- Introduce new features such as negotiation assistance and VR tours.
- Continuously update housing sources and AI models.

## How It Works

1. **User Registration & Preference Setup**

   - Users create an account and enter housing criteria (location, budget, size, etc.).

2. **Automated Listing Scan**

   - AI scrapes listings every few minutes and updates a database of available properties.

3. **Instant Match & Notification**

   - When a new listing meets the user’s preferences, an instant alert is sent.

4. **AI-Assisted Inquiry**

   - AI generates a response message for users to contact the landlord immediately.

5. **Ongoing Optimization**

   - AI adjusts recommendations based on feedback and changes in the housing market.

## Installation & Setup

### **Requirements**

- Python 3.8+
- Scrapy (for web scraping)
- OpenAI API (for NLP-powered responses)
- Twilio API (for SMS notifications)
- Firebase (for push notifications)
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB (for storing listings and user data)

### **Setup Instructions**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aiforhumans/projecthouse
   cd ai-housing-search
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure API keys in `.env`:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   TWILIO_SID=your_twilio_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
   FIREBASE_CONFIG=your_firebase_config
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

\*\*: Auto-suggesting counter-offers based on market trends.

- **VR Integration**: Virtual tours for properties before scheduling visits.
- **Voice Search**: Users can search via voice commands.
